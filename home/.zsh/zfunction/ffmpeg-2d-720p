# ffa7
# This function takes in a given file and extracts all of its video, audio, and
# subtitle tracks using FFmpeg. Then, it re-encodes the video tracks, using
# settings designed to balance high quality and reasonable speed. Finally,
# it reduces the encoded files to 720p resolution. This function is optimized 
# for 2D animated content.
